Description: Implementing a simple game using CV.

For Mid-Evaluation, we have built a model to classify images hand images as rock, paper and scissors. We primarily used Python alongwith Tensorflow and Keras Packages. We used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to build this model. We tackled overfitting using [Data augmentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/data_augmentation). 80% : 20% Training-Validation split. The dataset we used for this model is [Tensorflow Rock-Paper-Scissors Images](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/rock_paper_scissors).

Input size of images - 300x300 

Training Accuracy - 96.00%

Validation Accuracy - 99.60%

Test Accuracy - 90.51%

F1 Score - 

All the code can be accessed in the MainMODEL file.
